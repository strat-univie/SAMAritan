        "Suggest targeted interventions based on organizational design principles from the work of Phanish Puranam and Markus Reitzig (do a web search if necessary to learn what they might have said on this topic)."
        "Draw on \"Evidence Knowledge\" files in Knowledge to support recommendations."

        "Redesigning roles or team structures"
        "Adjusting leadership practices"
